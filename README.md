## 📂 How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tarun0714/Stock_prediction_model.git
   cd Stock_prediction_model
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your stock data CSV** (or use yfinance to fetch data directly in the script)

4. **Run the model**
   ```bash
   python xgboost_model.py
   ```

## 📊 Example

Here's a sample of how to use the model in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from xgboost_model import StockPredictor

data = pd.read_csv('AAPL.csv')
model = StockPredictor()
model.train(data)
predictions = model.predict(data)
print(predictions.head())
```

The output plot below compares actual and predicted stock prices:
